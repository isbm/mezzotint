Welcome to Mezzotint documentation!
==================================

.. note::
   This documentation covers Mezzotint |version| — the solution to
   convert a container (OCI or any other type) into an app-bundle,
   leaving behind unnecessary "dead code" — libraries that are never
   really used.

   Mezzotint is in early continuous development version and is **experimental**.
