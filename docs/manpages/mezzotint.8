.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]mezzotint\f[R] \[em] a tool to turn a root filesystem of a
container into an App Bundle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]mezzotint\f[R] [\f[B]OPTIONS\f[R]]\&... [\f[B]FILTERS\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Drops unnecessary libraries and files from a container, thus minimises
its overall size and converts a typical OCI container to be close as
application bundle, keeping isolation and scalability features.
.PP
In essence, Mezzotint operates by containerizing a binary software.
It achieves this by scanning the remaining files in the
\f[B]current\f[R] root filesystem to identify a specific set of files
that serve as dependencies for this software.
Mezzotint then eliminates all other unnecessary artifacts that
aren\[cq]t required during the software\[cq]s runtime\[em]those which
remain unused or aren\[cq]t loaded during the software\[cq]s operation.
.PP
Often, packages introduce numerous additional dependencies that end up
in the root filesystem without actually being essential for the intended
use of the software.
Such scenario is quite common when provisioning a root filesystem from a
collection of packages.
This results to the unnecessary bloat of the root filesystem, which
leads to oversized containers that actually can be much smaller.
.SH WORKFLOW
.PP
The workflow is quite simple to understand:
.IP \[bu] 2
Create a minimal root filesystem using \f[B]debootstrap\f[R] or similar
tools
.IP \[bu] 2
Install into that root filesystem your software and configure it as you
wish
.IP \[bu] 2
Pass that mounted root filesystem to the \f[B]mezzotint\f[R] tool for
examination and data optimisation
.IP \[bu] 2
Test and commit your container to a registry
.SS Options
.TP
-x, \[en]exe 
Specify path to an executable which needs to be preserved
.TP
-p, \[en]profile

.TP
-t, \[en]dry-run

.TP
-a, \[en]autodeps

\f[I]NOTE: This can increase the size, but might not always be
useful\f[R].
Default value: \f[B]none\f[R].
Other possible values are: \f[B]free\f[R], \f[B]clean\f[R],
