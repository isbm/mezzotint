Next Steps
----------

Congratulations on reducing the size of your container! Now, as your container is much smaller than it usually would be, you can proceed with the following actions:

- Publish your application on an OCI registry.
- Convert your app-bundle container into a Flake package for distribution it via any package manager available for a Linux distribution of your choice.

Please note, however, that this document does not provide instructions on how to perform these tasks.
